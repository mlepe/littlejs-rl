## Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features

### When to Use Chat (VS Code Copilot)

Use chat for **immediate fixes during active development**:

- Quick bugs that need fixing right now
- Syntax errors or compile issues
- Questions about how to implement something
- Iterative debugging (I can see your files and fix them directly)
- Code refactoring or improvements
- Understanding existing code

**Benefits:**

- Immediate response and fixes
- I have full context of your codebase
- Can make edits directly to your local files
- Interactive back-and-forth debugging
- Faster workflow

### When to Create GitHub Issues

Create issues for **tracking and organization**:

- Feature requests you want to implement later
- Bugs you discovered but don't need fixed immediately
- Ideas for future improvements
- Documentation that needs writing
- Refactoring tasks for later
- Breaking down large features into smaller tasks

**Benefits:**

- Track progress over time
- Document decisions and discussions
- Share with other contributors
- Keep a history of what's been implemented
- Organize work with labels and milestones

## Workflow Recommendation

1. **During coding session with Copilot**: Report everything in chat
2. **After coding session**: Create GitHub issues for:
   - Features discussed but not implemented
   - Bugs discovered but deferred
   - Ideas that came up during discussion
3. **Planning next session**: Review GitHub issues to decide what to work on
4. **Start coding**: Jump back into chat for implementation

## Example Workflow

```
Chat: "I found a bug where the player can walk through walls"
→ Copilot fixes it immediately

Chat: "We should add an inventory system eventually"
→ After session: Create GitHub issue "Add inventory system with weight capacity"

Next session: Review issue, discuss in chat, implement with Copilot's help
```

This way you get the best of both worlds: immediate help when coding + organized tracking for the long term!
