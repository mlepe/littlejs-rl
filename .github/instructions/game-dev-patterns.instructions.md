# Game development patterns

This document outlines common game development patterns and best practices to follow when creating a game. These patterns help ensure code maintainability, scalability, and overall quality.

If appropriate, we would like to follow common game development patterns such as:

- ECS
- Finite State Machines
- And any other pattern that would improve the project _without the shadow of a doubt_
- etc.

And follow the best practices in terms of game development.
